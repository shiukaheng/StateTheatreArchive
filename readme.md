# State Theatre archive demo
This is a tech demo for an upcoming project "Lost Metropolis", which uses photogrammetry along with Three.js, potree-core and WebAudio to immersively recreate unique urban spaces lost to redevelopment. This demo in particular features scans from the State Theatre building, a semi-abandoned complex in Hong Kong scheduled for redevelopment.
